    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  15,616    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     62
      Number with same-slice register load:     61
      Number with same-slice carry load:         1
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,249 out of  15,822    7%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       640 out of  31,644    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,849
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,453 out of   3,849   63%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              96 out of 126,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
