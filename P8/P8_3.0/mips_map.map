  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of  31,644    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           12
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             3 out of      12   25%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      12    0%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               6 out of 126,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
